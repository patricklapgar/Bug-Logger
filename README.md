## Native Desktop Bug Log Tracking Tool

I built this not too long ago to help my project team keep a log of bugs as we developed our projects.

It works quite well, but a few kinks need to be worked out in the near future...

To use this app, simply fork the repo, download the zip file, and away you go!!
